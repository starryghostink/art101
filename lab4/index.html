			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to write Javascript and to pseudocode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We were unclear about how detailed to be on the tasks assigned. We struggled a bit with the order of steps for the pseudocode. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This project went well overall. Both the everyday task and game made us think about how things are set-up. We put all our energy
						into the tasks at hand which took a couple hours. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
						<pre><code>							Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies
							Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
							Gather ingredients.
								Pull out sticks of butter to soften.
								Get out 2 large mixing bowls.
								Pull out a carton of eggs.
								Pull out vanilla extract, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips.
								Pull out white sugar and brown sugar.
								Pull out white flour.
							Combine dry and wet ingredients respectively in their own bowls.
								Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
								Break eggs into a bowl on their own. Try to pull out any shell pieces.
							Put ingredients into the mixer and let them mix.
								First, put the sticks of butter in and let it mix for a minute.
								Second, add the sugars and let it mix until it has a fluffy texture.
								Third, add the eggs to the mixing bowl one by one, letting them incorporate while the mixer is at a low setting. Add the vanilla extract too.
								Fourth, add the flour, baking soda, and salt slowly, giving it time to mix.
								Finally, add chocolate chips and let them mix in.
							Scoop your cookies onto a cookie sheet, and put them in the oven.
							Check the cookies after 10 minutes and continue to check them until they are a satisfying golden-brown color.
